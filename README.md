# A multi-module project with 10 android library modules being published to JitPack

This branch has 10 modules being published to JitPack. Users are still able to add all modules
to their projects in one line;

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.jitpack:android-example:1.0'
}
```

Verified that all modules are successfully imported by clients using;

- AGP 7.1.0 and Gradle (wrapper) 7.2 
- AGP 7.0.3 and Gradle (wrapper) 7.0.2
